Visiting the webpage, it shows a textbox, and a title of 'School of Scholars and Top Intelligents':

The main clue here is SSTI, not to be confused with the title of the webpage: SSTI (Server Side Template Injection). So we need to inject code into the textbox which we can run shell and commands to find the flag.
This webpage gives a good flow of what we can do: https://medium.com/@nyomanpradipta120/ssti-in-flask-jinja2-20b068fdaeee

In the textbox, we need to use a payload inside of {{}}. The one we will try is  ```{{‘’.__class__.__mro__}}```

We are now able to access the class objects. We will add `[1].__subclasses__()` at the end of the payload to access the subclasses which allows us to get the shell commands.

Nice! 
We now need to access  ```<class 'subprocess.Popen'>```, which is element 350 (by trial and error, or counting will work but is time consuming).

Using info from this: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection/README.md#exploit-the-ssti-by-calling-subprocesspopen
We can add ('<SHELL COMMAND>',shell=True,stdout=-1).communicate()[0].strip() to the end of our payload to do shell commands. The first command we will do is 'ls' to list all files in the directory.

This shows a file called 'flag' which is what we want. Next command is 'cat flag' to access the contents of that file and get the flag.

Doing so will give us this. A simple Ctrl+F gives us:

We got our flag using this:
```
{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[350]('cat flag',shell=True,stdout=-1).communicate()[0].strip()}}
```

Flag: ACSI{s0m3t1m3s_my_g3n1u5...it5...it5_alm05t_fr1ght3ning...}
